The file stem must be "fallDetect", read the fallDetect.tree file, 
build a c4.5 tree, the read the fallDetect.cases, finally run test cases.
The Cases must have a Class type at the last position of case. 
But the class type can be any no, it is doesn't matter.


TODO:The next work is remove the class type from cases.
